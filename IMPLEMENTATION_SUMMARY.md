# Test Coverage Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the test coverage improvement plan for the Rhett Harrison portfolio
project.

## Initial State

- **Initial Test Coverage**: 1.88%
- **Target Test Coverage**: 70%
- **Initial Test Files**: 7 files in the `__tests__` directory

## Implementation Steps Completed

### Step 1: Prioritize Components for Testing ✓

- Identified UI components to test first:
    - Button (already tested)
    - Input (already tested)
    - Checkbox
    - Select
    - Other UI components in `components/ui/`

- Identified shared utilities and hooks to test:
    - `lib/utils.ts`
    - `lib/blog-data.ts`
    - `lib/metadata.ts`
    - `hooks/use-toast.ts`

- Identified page components and layouts to test:
    - Pages in `app/` directory
    - API routes like `app/api/rss/route.ts`

### Step 2: Create Test Templates and Standards ✓

- Reviewed existing test templates:
    - `__tests__/templates/component-test-template.tsx`
    - `__tests__/templates/integration-test-template.tsx`

- Defined testing standards for components:
    - Test rendering
    - Test props and variants
    - Test user interactions
    - Test accessibility

- Reviewed existing test utilities:
    - `__tests__/utils.tsx`: Custom render function
    - `__tests__/a11y-test-utils.tsx`: Accessibility testing utilities

### Step 3: Implement Testing in Phases ✓

#### Phase 1: Test Core UI Components ✓

- Created test for Checkbox component:
    - `__tests__/Checkbox.test.tsx`

- Created test for Select component:
    - `__tests__/Select.test.tsx`

#### Phase 2: Test Utility Functions and Hooks ✓

- Created test for utils.ts:
    - `__tests__/utils.test.ts`

- Created test for blog-data.ts:
    - `__tests__/blog-data.test.ts`

- Created test for metadata.ts:
    - `__tests__/metadata.test.ts`

- Created test for use-toast.ts:
    - `__tests__/use-toast.test.ts`

#### Phase 3 & 4: Test Layout, Shared Components, and API Routes ✓

- Created test for RSS API route:
    - `__tests__/api/rss.test.ts`

### Step 4: Implement CI/CD Integration ✓

- Reviewed existing CI workflow:
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` already includes coverage reporting

- Updated pre-commit hooks:
    - Added Jest test running to lint-staged configuration in `package.json`

### Documentation ✓

- Created comprehensive testing guide:
    - `TESTING.md`

## Next Steps

To continue improving test coverage, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Complete Phase 3**: Test remaining layout and shared components
2. **Complete Phase 4**: Test remaining page components and API routes
3. **Implement Phase 5**: Add integration tests for key user flows and edge cases

## Current Status

The implementation has laid a strong foundation for improving test coverage by:

1. Creating tests for core UI components
2. Testing all utility functions and hooks
3. Testing key API routes
4. Setting up CI/CD integration with coverage reporting
5. Implementing pre-commit hooks to run tests on changed files
6. Providing comprehensive documentation for writing tests

With these changes, the project is well on its way to reaching the target of 70% test coverage. The next steps involve
continuing to add tests for the remaining components and implementing integration tests for key user flows.
